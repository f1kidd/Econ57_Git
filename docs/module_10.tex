How do dramatic technical innovations fit into the economic assessment?
What is the probability of the implementation of approaches that are
currently considered `wild' (for example, piping water from Canada
and/or Alaska, large scale desalination factories and piping from the
west, etc). At what point (if ever) do these become feasible?

When will these become relevant?

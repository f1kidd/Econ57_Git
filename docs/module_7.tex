  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    The Porter Hypothesis
  \end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Environmental protection does not grow on itself
\item
  We will have to divert private and public resources to improve
  environmental quality
\item
  What are the costs? And how do we measure it?

\hypertarget{engineering-costs}{%
\subsection{Engineering Costs}\label{engineering-costs}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  How much will our society spend on:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Equipment (installing and maintaining)
  \item
    Personnel
  \item
    Governmental regulatory efforts
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The most widespread cost figure out there
\item
  This is often the \emph{predicted} cost, and assumptions have to be
  made:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    On the choice of pollution-abating technology
  \item
    On the cost of that technology
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\item
  The ``free-lunch'' argument

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    There are environmentally friendly policies are also cost-saving
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The Porter Hypothesis

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Michael Porter from Harvard (the Five Forces Model)
  \item
    Regulation forces newer, modern production processes, extra R\&D
  \item
    Promotes thinking ``outside-the-box''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Empirical evidence generally supports the Porter Hypothesis
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Business complaints

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Regulatory burdens
  \item
    Administrative costs: filling for permits, holding public hearings
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Less evidence on actual productivity decreases

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Limited impacts in heavily regulated industries (coal mining)
  \item
    Rolling back environmental regulations would not help those
    industries anyway
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{jobs-vs.-the-environment}{%

Is environmental regulation:

\begin{itemize}

\item
  Job killers?
\item
  ``Green Jobs'' engine?
\item
  Or, neither?
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{questions}{%

\subsection{Are there economy-wide structural changes in employment
because of environmental
regulation?}\label{are-there-economy-wide-structural-changes-in-employment-because-of-environmental-regulation}}

No!

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  US lost millions of manufacturing jobs since 1980, timing coincided
  with new environmental regulation
\item
  But, that is mainly due to

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Automation
  \item
    Production shipped off-shore
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Structural unemployment} is possible when transiting from
  dirty manufacturing to clean services jobs
\item
  In the ``long run'', the economy still has \textbf{full employment}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Definitely true under today's economy
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{how-many-jobs-are-killed-from-environmental-regulation}{%
\subsection{How many jobs are killed from environmental
regulation?}\label{how-many-jobs-are-killed-from-environmental-regulation}}

Of course, there are short-term, local impacts due to environmental
regulation

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Plants shutdown
\item
  Decreasing competitiveness
\item
  Forced layoff
\end{itemize}

But other times, these are just scapegoats for poor
management/inevitable business cycles

\hypertarget{how-many-green-jobs-will-be-created}{%
\subsection{How many green jobs will be
created?}\label{how-many-green-jobs-will-be-created}}

Sen Markey claims the Green New Deal will ``create'' 10 million jobs.

What's the problem with that statement?

\hypertarget{opportunity-cost}{%
\subsection{Opportunity cost}\label{opportunity-cost}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If the government do not invest in the green sector, it can always
  invest in somewhere else
\item
  The \textbf{opportunity cost} of investing in the green sector:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Invest in other sectors
  \item
    Rebate to citizens (tickle-down economics)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  The REAL job created is 10 million minus number of jobs created in
  alternative investments

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    This could be more or less than 10 million
  \item
    That also depends on whether green spending alleviates structural
    unemployment
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{structural-unemployment}{%
\subsection{Structural Unemployment}\label{structural-unemployment}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In the ``long-run'', NO net jobs will be created

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Full employment in 1974, full employment now
  \end{itemize}
\item
  But as Keynes famously put it, ``in the long run we are all dead''
\item
  Investing in green energy could alleviate short-run structural
  unemployment

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Most jobs are blue-collar in nature (solar panel installer)
  \item
    Is that the type of job we want in the long term?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{obamas-green-stimulus-package}{%
\subsection{Obama's green stimulus
package}\label{obamas-green-stimulus-package}}

\begin{itemize}

  \$100 billion over two years

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Energy retrofit
  \item
    Smart electricity grid
  \item
    Expand mass transit and rails
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Will create 1.9 million jobs
\item
  Rebating that money to household will create 1.7 million jobs

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Freedom dividend (UBI)
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Net job creation: only 200,000
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Are firms fleeing to places with lax environmental
regulation?}\label{are-firms-fleeing-to-places-with-lax-environmental-regulation}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In theory, firms would want to move to places where
  environmental/labor regulations are more ``business friendly''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    U.S. South
  \item
    Developing countries: China, Vietnam, Mexico, Honduras, \ldots{}
  \end{itemize}
\item
  This gives them comparative advantages as they do not have to bear the
  cost of compliance
\item
  This phenomenon is referred to as the \textbf{pollution haven}
  hypothesis
\item
  Globalization \& trade liberalization may in theory exacerbate
  pollution havens
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{some-empirical-evidence}{%
\subsection{Some empirical evidence}\label{some-empirical-evidence}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mild evidence that stringent environmental policy leads to within
  country industrial shifts in the US:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Fewer new plants
  \item
    Fewer incoming foreign investment
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Environmental policy also correlates with labor costs/regulations in
  the US

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    ``Labor haven'' rather than ``pollution haven''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  NO evidence of pollution outsourcing to developing countries

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Not from US to rest of the world
  \item
    Not from Japan to Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{the-political-economy-of-pollution-haven}{%
\subsection{The political economy of pollution
haven}\label{the-political-economy-of-pollution-haven}}

A closely related concept to the pollution haven is the idea of
\textbf{race to the bottom}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Politicians attract investments by voluntarily lowering standards of
  environmental regulation
\item
  Prevalent if environmental standards are set and enforced by the local
  government
\item
  Weaker institutional and public oversight exacerbates the problem

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Chances for bureaucrats to seek rents
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{promotion-tournament-and-perverse-incentives-in-china}{%
\subsection{Promotion Tournament and Perverse Incentives in
China}\label{promotion-tournament-and-perverse-incentives-in-china}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  China was a central-planning economy before 1982
\item
  Deng Xiaoping started the economic reform, bringing Western
  ``market-based'' economy to China
\item
  Rapid economic growth since then, the ``China miracle''

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Lifted 1 BILLION people out of poverty
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{bureaucrat-incentives}{%
\subsection{Bureaucrat incentives}\label{bureaucrat-incentives}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Economic development was the No.1 imperative in the 1990s to early
  2000s

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Deng: ``It doesn't matter whether a cat is black or white, as long
    as it catches mice.''
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Promotions of bureaucrats were (almost) entirely based on economic
  performance

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Bureaucrats do not directly answer to constituents. Rather they
    answer to the Party HR (the Organization Department of CCP)
  \item
    GDP was the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) to determine promotion
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Best way to boost GDP: attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    FDI brought in capital and technology, quickly lifted the economy up
  \item
    Also gained the opportunity to seek rents (bribes)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{race-to-the-bottom}{%
\subsection{Race to the bottom}\label{race-to-the-bottom}}

This quickly turns into a tournament for FDI:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Every city would go up and down to attract investment
\item
  Environmental protection was often sidelined

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Environmental protection bureau was under direct control of the city
    Mayor/Party Secretary
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Negligence

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Why would an official care about the environment if that did not
    affect his/her promotion?
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{kong-and-chen-2015}{%
\subsection{Kong and Chen (2015)}\label{kong-and-chen-2015}}

``Combining the opportunity (to seek rents) with the pressure of time
(that bureaucrats are actually in power), attracting FDI often becomes
the top priority for the local (government), with almost all their
manpower and at all costs. Because that the (incentive) of getting FDI
is so high, it is not difficult to understand that the government gives
out (public) lands for free, offers subsequent tax breaks, and
\textbf{turns a blind eye to environmental pollution}''

\begin{itemize}

\item
  FDI usually have better environmental performance than private or
  state-owned enterprises

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Better technology
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Environmental indicators have been added into bureaucrats' KPI

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    President Hu Jintao: Sustainable development
  \item

\hypertarget{a-different-type-of-incentives}{%

turned around

\begin{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Carbon cap-and-trade

Environmental taxes can:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Correct the externality from pollution

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    What a tax/cap-and-trade is intended to do
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Raise governmental revenue

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Can be used to correct other distortionary taxes
  \item
    Income tax, capital gain tax, etc.
  \end{itemize}

Economists call that the \textbf{``double-dividend''} hypothesis.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The top priority for any environmental policy is to correct for market
  failures

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Revenue-generating policy may or may not be the most
    efficient/feasible one to achieve that goal
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Lots of real-world policies are revenue neutral, or even
  revenue-losing

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Sulfur dioxide trading: permits are handed out for free
  \item
    Conservation reserves: providing subsidies to landowners for
    conservation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Rebate with a lump-sum payment (freedom-dividend): welfare losses
  \item
    Cutting existing capital taxes: small welfare gains
  \item
    Cutting existing labor taxes: almost no effect
  \end{itemize}
\item
  These effects are really small in magnitude

  \begin{itemize}
